        This week marks the first week that I am able to start learning CSS,
        super psyched! Today small snippets of what I learned about translucent
        borders from the very talented Lea Verou's book,
        <a

        >.

        Click <a href="/demo/translucent-borders.html">here</a> for the demo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that applying hsla on border property is not enough. This is
        because the background property color extends beneath the border. This
        is why the supposed semi-transparent border has a green hue. Therefore
        we need to "clip" the background from the border area and only within
        the content and padding area.
